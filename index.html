                    <p>I have the privelege of saying that I was one of the small few that was actually able to call him Vernon. Aside from "Ma" his mother, I was the only other one that ever got to call him that. To everyone else he was known just as Vern. Unfortunately he passed away before he even turned 30. Such a beautiful life cut short. Vern was an electrician and in his last few years he got injured a few times on the job. Devestating spine injuries that forced him to stop working. He struggled tremendously for lots of different reasons, he had a very difficult life both emotionally and physically. But I loved him more than anything and would give anything to have been there to have helped him stay alive in his last moments. I miss him every single day and wish I could just have 1 more minute with him. I loved him dearly and he will never be forgotten. </p>

                    <p>Vern was a different breed of individual. I have never met anyone like him in all my life. When I first met him I wasn't sure what to make of him. His personality was all over the place so I couldn't tell what type of person was he. His BFF was in a relationship with my BFF so he was around a lot. As time grew on and over the years we became closer and closer and he grew on me.
                        <br> He turned into being "My Everything" and we developed and amazing freindship!</p>

                    <P>Vernon was an all or nothing kind of friend. Vern loved the people in his life with everything he had in him. First Impressions would say his was a skater bad boy, and he was in fact a skater but not a bad boy, he was just a crazy, goofy, blunt and honest, huge Teddy Bear. Vern let every person in his life know exactly who he was, flaws and all. He was extremely honest and usually never held back his opinions. Most people wouldn't appreaciate judgement like that from someone, but the way he would go about his opinions is that he would treat it like a "Roast" and in turn created some incredible friendships. He was unique, funny, energetic, positive, full of jokes, full of kindness. He had the biggest heart ever but also a fierce one if you ever messed with him or someone he loved, he protected them till the end.
                            <br> I Love you Vernon, Always and Forever!!! Say hi to Pauli and Kittie for me, take care of them!!</p>
